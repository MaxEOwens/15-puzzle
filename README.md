# 📱15 Puzzle Game with Leaderboards – CSC 680 Final Project

## 👥 Team Members
- Max Owens
- Hilary Lui
## Project Overview
For our final project, we are developing a 15 Puzzle Game App – a modern take on the classic sliding puzzle. The app will allow players to move numbered tiles in a 4x4 grid to arrange them in order. In addition to core puzzle functionality, we will include leaderboards to allow users to track their best times and moves to finish.

Our goal is to create an engaging and polished app that demonstrates our understanding of iOS development.

This project not only reflects our programming knowledge but also gives us something impressive to share with future employers.
